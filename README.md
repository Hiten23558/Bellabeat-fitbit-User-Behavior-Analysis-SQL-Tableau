# Bellabeat Fitbit User Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Fitbit fitness tracker data to identify user behavior patterns and provide data-driven recommendations for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company. The analysis focuses on activity levels, sedentary behavior, engagement consistency, and opportunities for personalized wellness interventions.

---

## 🧠 Business Questions
- How active are Bellabeat users on a typical day?
- Do step counts alone explain calorie burn?
- Which user segments offer the highest opportunity for behavior change?
- How consistent are users in maintaining daily activity habits?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SQLite)** – data cleaning, aggregation, segmentation
- **Tableau Public** – dashboard creation & storytelling
- **Excel / CSV** – intermediate analysis datasets
- *(Optional)* Python – exploratory data analysis

## 🔍 Analysis Summary

### 1. User Activity Overview
- Daily step counts vary widely across users.
- Many users record zero-step days, indicating inconsistent routines.
- Step counts alone do not fully explain calorie expenditure.

### 2. User Segmentation
- Users were segmented into Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, and Very Active groups.
- Over half of users fall below recommended activity levels.
- Most users cluster just below optimal activity thresholds, presenting a strong opportunity for behavior nudges.

### 3. Engagement & Habit Consistency
- Zero-step days reveal hidden engagement risk.
- Users with similar average activity levels often differ significantly in consistency.
- Habit consistency is a stronger indicator of long-term engagement than peak performance.

## 📊 Dashboards
Three Tableau dashboards were created:

1. **User Activity Overview**
2. **User Segmentation & Growth Opportunity**
3. **Engagement & Habit Consistency**

Screenshots are available in the `tableau/` folder.

## 💡 Key Recommendations
- Shift focus from step totals to habit consistency.
- Target lightly and moderately active users with achievable goals.
- Reduce sedentary behavior through frequent low-intensity movement prompts.
- Use zero-step days as triggers for personalized engagement nudges.
